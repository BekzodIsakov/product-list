# Project description

This is an SPA bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It contains a
list of products of different categories which can be edited, deleted, created
and filtered. The app also features pagination. All the data is served by
[json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) from
[https://my-json-server.typicode.com/](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/BekzodIsakov/db-json/products).
If you wish to change the data on the server, fork
[this github repository](https://github.com/BekzodIsakov/db-json)
